# odin-recipes

This project showcases basic HTML skills that I have learned throughout the foundations course in the Odin Project. 

The specific skills this project shows are:
-Setting up a GitHub repository
-Connect that GitHub repository to my local machine using Git
-Creating a basic HTML site that includes links, ordered and unordered lists, images, headers, paragraphs, and basic HTML meta data
-Staging and committing the project to GitHub using Git
